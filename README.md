# Description

It's a pack of five games for growing up your math intelligence.

* **Even number** - it's a game where one needs to answer correctly is even a random number or not.
* **Missing number** - it's a game where one needs to find a missing number in progression.
* **Calculation** - it's a game where that needs calc for random math operation for two random numbers.
* **GSD** - it's a game where one needs to find the Greatest Common Divisor for two random numbers.
* **Prime Number** - it's a game where one needs to answer correctly whether is prime a random number or not.
